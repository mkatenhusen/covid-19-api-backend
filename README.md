This project was created during the WirVsHackathon, a hackathon launched by the German government to enable the society building solutions for the society in order to minimize the impact of the Covid19 crisis.

It wraps data for each county (Landkreis) in Germany about infections, deaths etc. on a daily basis. Just see our docs to get a feeling what's possible :)
